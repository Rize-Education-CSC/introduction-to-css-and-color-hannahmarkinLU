    At a young age, I had a keen eye for art and visually-appealing layouts. This has stuck with me throughout my life and is something I am excited to bring into my dream career as a web developer. I am truly passionate about code and web design and aim to learn and grow with every project I take on.

    Outside of web development, one of my favorite hobbies is going to concerts. I have attended 5 concerts since 2019 and have 3 more planned for this year. I absolutely love music and regularly find myself completely immersed in the instrumentals and lyricism. That experience is only amplified at concerts with the addition of breath-taking visuals and seeing the band or artist perform right in front of me. It's an amazing feeling that never gets old.
